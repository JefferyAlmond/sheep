# sheep

I purchased a book called "Hello App Inventor!" under the assumption that it was a volume on beginner's Android progrmming, but instead turned out to be a how-to manual on the App Inventor design environment, which wasunfortunately too simple for my needs. I still used a few of the book's suggested projects for my inspiration, including this simple app which displays a simple sheep icon which emits a "baa!" sound when pressed, and displays a message when the device is shaken.
